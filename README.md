# Showcase

Built with Swift and Firebase

## Description

Showcase what YOU want to show to the world. Show off any projects, extracurriculars, images, and events that you want. Browse other people's profiles and see what they're up to! If you aren't ready to share your profile with the world yet, don't worry, you can set your profile to Private Mode.

## How to Use

To view other user's profiles, simply tap on their cell in the Home screen.

To edit your profile, tap "Edit Profile" in the top left corner of your profile screen and tap "Save" after you make the changes you want. Note that all you need to do is tap anywhere in the "Change Profile Picture" area (it's coded as an enabled button when you tap "Edit Profile") to change the profile picture.

To add a card, tap the plus icon in the top right corner of your profile screen. Upon adding a card, it will not immediately show in the card list - the reason for this is because the image takes a little time to upload into Firebase Storage.

Please note that images may take a few seconds to load.

To delete a card, swipe the card to the left and tap "Delete".

To enable private mode, go to the Settings screen and turn on the "Private Mode" switch. By default, your profile is public.
